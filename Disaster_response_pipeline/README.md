## Project overview

- Analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

- Create a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that you can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.

The project will include a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. 
<br>
The web app will also display visualizations of the data.
