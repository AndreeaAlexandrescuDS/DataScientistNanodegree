## Project 1: Write A Data Science Blog Post

Python libraries used in the project:
- pandas, numpy, datatable, datetime, IPython, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scipy, sklearn, folium, wordcloud, networkx, statsmodels, cufflinks

Motivation of the project
<br>
The AirBnb datasets were more chanlenging then the Stackoverflow surveys:
- data is more diverse : numerical, categorical, texts(reviews)
- the ML techniques one could use on this data are more difficult
- the graphics are more diverse : maps, time series, barplots, pies, correlation networks
- I've been to Sicily and data made more sense to me than Boston or New York city

There are two files in the project:
- setup.py contains needed libraries and functions
- Sicilia-Airbnb-house-prices-EDA.ipynb contains all the rest

Summary of the results I got from the project:
 - Sicily has a lot of Airbnb properties all over the island, at all preferred prices
 - you'll pay more for more baths and bedrooms (not a surprise)
 - the most expensive neighbourhoods are the ones loved by tourists (like Taormina)
 - the cheapest are Gela and Catania(big city with lots of homes available)
 - reviews are an important factor in price
 - prices go up a bit during summer
 - most properties are available until 2022, but this is probably due to covid restrictions :(
