### Blog post 
<a href="https://andreea-alexandrescu88.medium.com/sicily-airbnb-homes-analysis-b5214b1df545">Sicily AirBnb homes analysis</a>
<br><br>

### Python libraries
- pandas, numpy, datatable, datetime, IPython, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scipy, sklearn, folium, wordcloud, networkx, statsmodels, cufflinks

### Motivation
<br>

The AirBnb datasets were more chalenging then the Stackoverflow surveys:
- data is more diverse : numerical, categorical, texts(reviews)
- the ML techniques one could use on this data are more difficult
- the graphics are more diverse : maps, time series, barplots, pies, correlation networks
- I've been to Sicily and data made more sense to me than Boston or New York city

### Project structure
There are two files in the project:
- setup.py contains needed libraries and functions
- 1.Sicilia-Airbnb-house-prices.ipynb contains all the rest

### Summary of the results
 - Sicily has a lot of Airbnb properties all over the island, at all preferred prices
 - you'll pay more for more baths and bedrooms (not a surprise)
 - the most expensive neighbourhoods are the ones loved by tourists (like Taormina)
 - the cheapest are Gela and Catania(big city with lots of homes available)
 - reviews are an important factor in price
 - prices go up a bit during summer
 - most properties are available until 2022, but this is probably due to covid restrictions :(
